**Some relevant background information about me:**

I studied statistics and math during undergraduate and a little bit finance of course(every one in UIBE study in finance somehow). Back then I aimed to land a career in the quantitative finance field. However, the beautiful spring when I studied in UC, Berkeley as a visited student was when my journey as a software developer started.

I did have a plenty of coding experience in python and R before, but CS61B was the first legit computer science course I've ever had and it was soooo fun (thank u, Prof. Hug)! I mean, designing those data structures, optimizing the runtime, and learning smart and tricky algorithms makes if the most interesting class in the world (challenging tho). I do enjoy the time our teammates and I spent days and nights in the Mottiff library working on our final project -- *Escape the Dungeon* [youtube demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahManehiq_8) . It involved lots of brainwork, communication, and huge self-fulfillment for sure! Gosh, I missed the good old day. 



**How I prepared for the technical interview:**

Sorry about my chatty personality. Here is the meat and potato. The summer after that semester, I started finding internship as a software developer. I reviewed data structure and java language again and again. I self-learnt system design (hard and need to recite and understand) and SQL(easy). Most importantly, a bunch of Leetcode problems (I think easy and medium is enough). I failed one interview because they asked me questions about NLP and I knew nothing about it at that time. I passed another interview (1 coding + 1 technical (data structures and some machine architecture) + projects experience + 1 HR behavioral) and got the job in a startup based in Shenzhen, China.

**How it feels like to work as a SWE (web app backend) in a tech start-up?**

Short answer: best summer I've ever had! (so much fun!)

Here comes to the real-world coding! It was very different from the coursework from cs61B. The first 2 weeks: 

* I need to spend 1/4 of my time getting familiar with product design (that is the guide of how you design your algorithm).
* 1/4 of time dealing with all kinds of software -- Postman(for testing), Jenkins(for deploying), Dokers(for running some resources), and Git(of course).  
* 1/4 communicating with other developers, 
* and only 1/4 I was truly siting in front of the screen quietly writing codes (and the codes built under *Spring boot* framework so I need to learnt how to use the framework).

But once I know how to use those software and learnt the product design detail in heart, my efficiency grew exponentially. 

**Most most valuable take-off:**

* Getting into the process of designing a product from scratch, building it, putting into to production, and getting feedback from the app users. It is literally like involving into a baby growing into an adult!
* Nice coding style and how to code in a big project (my trick: draw a logical plot instructing myself what kinds of files need to be created in what kinds of folders, and set it to be your PC wallpaper).
* My adorable colleagues. They are my tutors, my career and life mentors. I still ask them questions when I am doing some course projects now.

**Something I don't like:**

There is one thing I don't like at the very beginning of my internship is to remember those product design. Back then, I was thinking, "Well, this is not an interesting product, and there are so many details need to remember. Why I waste such a long time learning the functions of the product rather than designing algorithm?" I was so wrong back then. Knowing products and discussing clientsâ€™ needs with product managers in advance is the key of writing robust and reusable code. I know it takes time. But a good engineer must be **a curious and quick learner**, isn't it?

(Plus, you can choose to work for a team that building up the products that interest you. One day you can be a product manager yourself! Don't limit yourself to that tiny little screen size of codes!)
