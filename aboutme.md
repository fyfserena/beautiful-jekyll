First of all, I am an engineer. What an engineer does? Get to know the theoretical part the and turn it to an application. Yes, thinking is not enough, all is about getting your hands dirty!
  * Building cool stuff <= Stay curious and be a quick learner: Dig into products, strategies, models, algorithms and then realize them!
  * Solve problem <= Core skills: coding and frameworks


* A final year graduate student Master in Operations Research (Machine Learning track) at Columbia University Engineering school. I study statistics and computer science in [UIBE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_International_Business_and_Economics_(Beijing)) during undergraduate.

* A multidisciplinary software engineer with experience in software design, algorithm design, machine learning, deep learning and statistics.

* Always think about what can I do for our society? What can I do to influence people around me positively? These two principles help make decisions in my daily life.
